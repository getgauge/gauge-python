This project adds Python [language plugin](https://docs.gauge.org/plugins.html#language-reporting-plugins) for [gauge](http://gauge.org).

## Getting started

### Pre-requisite

- [Gauge](https://gauge.org/index.html)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Installation

```
gauge install python
```

### Create a gauge-python project

```
gauge init python
```

### Run tests

```
gauge run specs
```

### Useful links

- [User Docs](https://docs.gauge.org)
- [Setup Guide](https://gauge-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#development-guide)

### Alternate Installation options

#### Install specific version
```
gauge install python -v 0.2.3
[pip / pip3] install getgauge
```

### Offline installation
* Download the plugin from [Releases](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-python/releases)
```
gauge install python --file gauge-python-0.2.3.zip
[pip / pip3] install getgauge
```

#### Nightly installation
To install python nightly, download the latest nightly from [here](https://bintray.com/gauge/gauge-python/Nightly).

Once you have the downloaded nightly gauge-python-$VERSION.nightly-yyyy-mm-dd.zip, install using:

```
gauge install python -f gauge-python-$VERSION.nightly.yyyy-mm-dd.zip
[pip / pip3] install --pre getgauge==$VERSION.dev.yyyymmdd
```

#### Build from Source

##### Pre-Requisites

* [Golang](http://golang.org/)

##### Installing package dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Tests
```
python build.py --test
```

##### Tests Coverage
```
python build.py --test
coverage report -m
```

##### Installing
```
python build.py --install
```

##### Creating distributable
```
python build.py --dist
```

This will create a .zip file in bin directory and a .tar.gz file in dist directory.


##### Creating Nightly distributable
```
NIGHTLY=true python build.py --dist
```

This will create the .zip nightly file and a .dev.DATE.tar.gz(PyPi pre release package) file.

## Deployment

Only contributors with push access can create a deployment.

The deployment process is managed via Github Actions.

Follow these steps to deploy gauge-python.

* Create a Personal Access Token in Github with `repo:public_repo` scope (skip this step if you already have a PAT).
* Run `GITHUB_TOKEN={Your token} sh release.sh` in `gauge-python` dir. This will trigger a deployment workflow on Github Actions. This workflow creates a release draft with all required assets and information.
* Visit to the release draft, analyze and update the contents (remove unnecessary entries, mention Contributors, remove dependabot PR entries).
* Publish the draft release.
* Once the draft is published it will trigger another workflow on Github Actions, which will perform all the Post release tasks, In case of gauge-python it will upload the `getgauge` python packge to `PyPi`.
* Once it's done please update the new release information in [gauge-repository](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-repository/blob/master/python-install.json)
* That's it. Now the release can be announced on the required community platforms (chat, google group etc.)


## Examples

- Selenium: This project serves as an example for writing automation using Gauge. It uses selenium and various Gauge/Gauge-Python features. For more details, Check out the [gauge-example-python](https://github.com/kashishm/gauge-example-python) repository.

- Selenium and REST API: This project shows an example of how to setup Gauge, Gauge Python and [Magento](https://magento.com/) to test REST API. For more details, Check out the [blog](https://angbaird.com/2016/11/09/selenium-and-rest-api-testing-with-gauge/) or [gauge-magento-test](https://github.com/angb/gauge-magento-test) repository.
